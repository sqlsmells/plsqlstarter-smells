--View that determines which application is calling upon Core components. This 
--view does not work if app_env and app_db are not set up properly, with data
--for each application, database and environment. It also does not work if 
--multiple applications share the same schema. If you have multiple apps sharing
--the same schema, you will need to hardcode your application ID or code in
--PL/SQL and views that make use of the Core components that need to know which
--app you are.
